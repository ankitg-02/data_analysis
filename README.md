<h1>Descriptive Analysis</h1><br>
<h2>Here</h2><br>
<h3>We are identifying the sales of different products through the different segments via bar graphs.</h3><br>
Majorly the products are categorised into three types:-<br>
1.Office Supplies <br>  2.Home   <br>   3.Technolgy<br>
And the segments are distinguished into 3 types:-<br>
1.Corporate  <br> 2.Home Office   <br> 3.Consumer<br>
<h1>Diagonastic Analysis</h1><br>
<h3>We have to find the root cause of these trends of sales of different products for different segments.</h3><br>
<h1>Predictive Analysis</h1><br>
<h3>Here we are using DecisionTreeClassifer model to predict the segment of product through the modified dataset.</h3><br>
Through using LabelEncoder we can change string data-type of the specified columns of the dataset into numrical data-type.<br>
Now we will develop a model using DecisionTreeClassifer model to predict the relationship between Product ID and Ship Mode.<br>
